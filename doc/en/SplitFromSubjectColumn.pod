=head1 NAME

SplitFromSubjectColumn - Split the from/subject column in ticket overviews into two columns.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In the ticket overviews (ticket status view and ticket queue view) the sender and the subject (or ticket title) is in one column. This add-on splits this column into to columns.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

As the ticket search cannot sort by "from" or "subject" of the last mail, those two columns still trigger a "sort by title".

=head1 REPOSITORY & BUGTRACKER

The code repository and a bugtracker are available at L<http://github.com/reneeb/otrs-SplitFromSubjectColumn>.
