=head1 NAME

SplitFromSubjectColumn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In the ticket overviews (ticket status view and ticket queue view) the sender and the subject (or ticket title) is in one column. This add on splits this column into to columns.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

As the ticket search cannot sort by "from" or "subject" of the last mail, those two columns still trigger a "sort by title".

=head1 REPOSITORY & BUGTRACKER

The code repository and a bugtracker are available at L<http://github.com/reneeb/otrs-SplitFromSubjectColumn>.
